RIBOSOME PROFILING PROJECT, DISCOVERING TRIPLET PERIODICITY
================================================================================

WORKFLOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Wiggle files are converted to Mutalyzer position converter batch files using
the wig2batchfile.php script.
Usage: ./wig2batchfile.php WIG_FILE
It can create one mutalyzer file for multiple Wiggle files, but the analysis
script does not support that, so then they would need to be split afterwards.

2) The position converter batch files are manually loaded into Mutalyzer:
https://test.mutalyzer.nl/batchPositionConverter

3) When done, the results are downloaded and analyzed using the
analyze_codon_positions.php script, that checks if the ribosomes have indeed
been stopped at the start sites.
Usage:
./analyze_codon_positions.php MUTALYZER_FILE WIGGLE_FILE GENE_LIST_FILE STRAND

Example:
./analyze_codon_positions.php F.wig5_mutalyzer_batchfile_results.txt F.wig5 \
  mm10_gene_list.txt +

The script does the following things:
+ Read out the coverage information from the Wiggle file
+ Read the gene list to find out which genes (transcripts, actually) are on
  which strand
+ Read the Mutalyzer result file to see which locations map to which
  transcripts, determining the position within the transcript
  * Filter low coverage positions (< 3)
  * Mappings on non-coding transcripts are ignored
  * Mappings on transcripts on the other strand are ignored
  * Filter positions without transcript mapping
  * Filter positions with only intronic mapping
  * Filter positions too far from transcript start or stop sites
    (> 500bp)
  * The remaining possible mappings are processed.
    - 5' UTR or 3' UTR mappings, while exonic mappings are also
      available, are discarded.
    - If there are 5' UTR and 3' UTR mappings, but none in the exon
      region, we assume an intergenic situation and if one of the two
      positions is clearly closer to the translated region than the
      other (> 100bp), then the closest position is picked.
      If not, the position is reported.
    - After this, all mappings are counted by their coverage and
      reported.

Possible to do:
- Multiple 5' UTR *or* multiple 3' UTR mappings are all counted if these
are the only mappings. Perhaps we should pick the closest, like as if
both UTR mappings were present.
