While checking the sequences from the original SAM file with the sequences in
the UCSC genome browser, I noticed that some reads with different sequences were
mapped to the same transcript/position set.
To see how often this happens, you can use uniq twice (first with sequences,
then uniq -c without):

cat merged_A1.fastq.trunc.transcriptome.sam | cut -f 3,4,10 | cut -d "|" -f 4,5 | grep -vE '^(LN|\*)' | sort | uniq | cut -f 1,2| uniq -c | sort -g > merged_A1.fastq.trunc.transcriptome.sam.uniq_reads_counted

Top transcript (Ribosomal RNA) had 1700 different sequences for a certain
position, and over 1000 for other positions.
These different sequences all contained the CIGAR string 52M (52 nucleotides
matched). Later Ele realized, the M can also mean mismatch. Still, supposedly
the aligner allows only one mismatch, and these sequences were very different.

To see if this also occurs in the genome alignment, we checked those SAM files:
cat merged_A1.fastq.trunc_unaligned.transcriptome_aligned.genome.sam | cut -f 3,4,10 | cut -d "|" -f 4,5 | grep -vE '^(LN|\*)' | sort | uniq | cut -f 1,2| uniq -c | sort -g > merged_A1.fastq.trunc_unaligned.transcriptome_aligned.genome.sam.uniq_reads_counted

Mismatches were less grave, but at 52M (max read length), there were many
different sequences aligned to the same position.

To see all CIGAR strings with the sequences:
grep "chr18" merged_A1.fastq.trunc_unaligned.transcriptome_aligned.genome.sam | grep 54698911| cut -f 6,10 | sort | less

Ele thinks the "1 mismatch" is only valid for the start of the read, since the
start seemed pretty consistent.





To validate the results of the packed_sam2wiggle script, I checked 3 transcripts
with 3 locations each:

Results were manually checked in the UCSC genome browser. Aside from the
differences in sequence between the FASTA transcriptome reference sequence and
the genomic reference sequence (in NM_022988), the sequences matched 100%.
