# First, install the wiggelen package.
# For Ubuntu or Debian Linux users:

sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install wiggelen

# For Windows users:
# Do note, that the code below only runs on Linux. When running this on Windows,
# you'll need to run wiggelen yourself, grouping the correct Wiggle files
# together. Make sure the resulting Wiggle files are tab-delimited.
# 1- Install python (http://python.org/download/)
# 2- Install pip-Win (https://sites.google.com/site/pydatalog/python/pip-for-windows) and start pip-Win.
# 3- Run command 'pip install wiggelen' in the pip-Win screen.

# The merge_wigglefiles.sh script merges any wiggle files starting with the same
# part before the first dot (.) or underscore (_) in the file name together, and
# creates a merged wiggle file.
# It does so per strand (F and R), and separately for filtered and unfiltered
# data. This information is taken from the file name.
# NOTE: File names must contain "transcriptome_aligned" for the transcriptome
# alignments, and "genome_aligned" for the genomic alignments.
# The filtered transcriptome alignment files should end in
# ".F.filtered.wig5" and ".R.filtered.wig5".
# NOTE: The resulting wiggle file, created by wiggelen, uses spaces instead of
# tabs as separator, regardless of what the original files are using. It is not
# clear whether or not space or tab *should* be used; it seems that all services
# accept both. No official standard seems to exist. Since we are using tabs
# everywhere, because SAM tools are using them, we're replacing the spaces with
# tabs.



# After the merging, I noticed that some positions were in both wiggle files,
# which would mean that although some reads could not align to the
# transcriptome, they aligned just fine on the genome on the same position.
# Per chromosome, you can create a list like:

for pos in `diff -U 1 A1.fastq.trunc.transcriptome_aligned.sam.mappedforward.sam.M25.sam.3col.sam.packed.F.wig5_chr1 A1.merged_wiggle.F.wig5_chr1 | grep -E "^\-" | grep -v track | cut -d - -f 2 | cut -f 1`;
do
  grep -E "^${pos}\s" A1.fastq.trunc.transcriptome_aligned.sam.mappedforward.sam.M25.sam.3col.sam.packed.F.wig5_chr1 A1.merged_wiggle.F.wig5_chr1;
  echo "";
done | cut -d : -f 2 > A1.positions_with_coverage_in_both_wiggles_chr1.txt

# In one line:
