The fasta files that were used as reference sequence to align the ribosome
profiling reads to the transcriptome, are aligned to the genome to get the
positions we need to be able to map the ribosome profiling reads to the genome.
Mutalyzer was not able to do this, because of a bug that prevented using n.
positions. The seq_gene.md file downloaded from the NCBI was not able to do this
because of the NM not always perfectly matching the genome, and that file did
not indicate those differences, resulting in incorrect results.

The SAM files with the results of the alignment of the transcript fasta sequen-
ces are modified to shown only one possible alignment. However, there are still
some transcripts that show two alignments. These are considered "chimeric"
alignments and form an exception because the aligner can not choose between
them. However, none of these transcripts are very important;

$ grep -v "^@" RefseqFASTA_mapped-to-genome.sam | cut -d "|" -f 4 \
    | sort | uniq -c | grep -vE "^\s+1\s"

And they show bad alignment, as you can see by running (selecting NMs only):

$ grep -E "NM_001004145.2|NM_001013804.1|NM_001013828.2|NM_001039241.2|NM_001104634.1|NM_001163415.1|NM_001199242.1|NM_001199243.1|NM_001199332.1|NM_007849.1|NM_008848.1|NM_009251.1|NM_009744.3|NM_010381.2|NM_011087.1|NM_011093.1|NM_011154.2|NM_021545.1|NM_031156.3|NM_133362.2|NM_177010.3|NM_181729.2" \

Lots of clipping on either side; the multiple alignments were often in different
chromosomes, also.

Searching for these NMs in the SAM files of the alignments of the ribosome
footprints to the transcriptome show little reads mapped to them:

$ for file in *.sam; do echo $file; grep -E "NM_001004145.2|NM_001013804.1|NM_001013828.2|NM_001039241.2|NM_001104634.1|NM_001163415.1|NM_001199242.1|NM_001199243.1|NM_001199332.1|NM_007849.1|NM_008848.1|NM_009251.1|NM_009744.3|NM_010381.2|NM_011087.1|NM_011093.1|NM_011154.2|NM_021545.1|NM_031156.3|NM_133362.2|NM_177010.3|NM_181729.2" \
    $file | wc -l; done

Looking at the alignments, there is no way we can choose out of the two. Some-
times we don't even understand why they are split, since they seem to consist of
two subsequent mappings, but since very little reads map to these transcripts,
we choose to ignore them instead of trying to fix (?) the aligner.



Also, the script parsing the CIGAR string encounters transcripts with deletions
and insertions compared to the genome.
It is not reliably possible to deal with these. So we'll remove them from the
FASTA sequences and re-align all the reads.

How many transcripts (XM and NM selected):
$ grep -E "(N|X)M_" RefseqFASTA_mapped-to-genome.sam | cut -f 1,6 | grep -E "D|I" | cut -d "|" -f 4 > problematic_transcripts.txt
$ wc -l problematic_transcripts.txt

919

So how many reads align currently to these transcripts?
$ grep -f problematic_transcripts.txt A1.fastq.trunc.transcriptome_aligned.sam.mappedforward.sam.M25.sam.3col.sam | wc -l

33664

(these reads are not necessarily lost; we could regain them by genome alignment)



To identify the transcripts with a TIS located within a splice-junction or in
its close proximity (up to 15nt), use find_distance_to_ATG.php. The script
requires annotation of exons and the translated region for each transcript.
These annotations can be downloaded from:
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/M_musculus/mapview/seq_gene.md.gz
The script creates two files; one containing transcripts whose TIS cannot be
easily mapped with standard genome alignment, because of its proximity to a
splice junction (these transcript are referred to as "problematic transcripts",
sorted on the distance to the closest intron), and one file with transcripts
where no UTR is annotated so where the distance to any possible 5' intron is
unknown. A distance of 15 bases to the TIS is currently the default threshold,
based on a read length of around 30 nucleotides.

Usage:
./find_intron_distance_to_ATG.php seq_gene.md

Produces:
- seq_gene.md.distance_intron_to_ATG.txt
  Lists all transcripts where the distance of the intron to the TIS is 15
  nucleotides or less (distance is configurable by editing the file).
- seq_gene.md.distance_intron_to_ATG_errors.txt
  Lists all transcripts that have no UTR annotated, thus the 5' distance to a
  possible intron is unknown. For all these transcripts, the 3' distance is safe
  (> 15).



How many of these problematic transcripts will we have issues with the genome
alignment, since the ATG is too close to an exon/intron border?

$ grep -f problematic_transcripts.txt ./seq_gene_mouse.md.distance_intron_to_ATG.txt | wc -l
65

How many reads?

$ grep -f problematic_transcripts.txt A1.fastq.trunc.transcriptome_aligned.sam.mappedforward.sam.M25.sam.3col.sam | wc -l
1362



All transcripts with mapping issues to the genome are put in a separate file
created when running the mm10_transcript_positions_create.php script. This file
is named transcriptome_alignment_unsupported_transcripts.txt.
For each transcript, the reason why it was rejected is put in the second column.

The output file mm10_transcript_positions.txt contains the transcript ID, the
chromosome, the strand, and the exon positions encoded in JSON.
