The fasta files that were used as reference sequence to align the ribosome
profiling reads to the transcriptome, are aligned to the genome to get the
positions we need to be able to map the ribosome profiling reads to the genome.
Mutalyzer was not able to do this, because of a bug that prevented using n.
positions. The seq_gene.md file downloaded from the NCBI was not able to do this
because of the NM not always perfectly matching the genome, and that file did
not indicate those differences, resulting in incorrect results.

The SAM files with the results of the alignment of the transcript fasta sequen-
ces are modified to shown only one possible alignment. However, there are still
some transcripts that show two alignments. These are considered "chimeric"
alignments and form an exception because the aligner can not choose between
them. However, none of these transcripts are very important;

$ grep -v "^@" RefseqFASTA_mapped-to-genome_maxpath_2.sam | cut -d "|" -f 4 \
    | sort | uniq -c | grep -vE "^\s+1\s"

And they show bad alignment, as you can see by running:

$ grep -E "NM_001004145.2|NM_001013804.1|NM_001013828.2|NM_001039241.2|NM_001104634.1|NM_001163415.1|NM_001199242.1|NM_001199243.1|NM_001199332.1|NM_007849.1|NM_008848.1|NM_009251.1|NM_009744.3|NM_010381.2|NM_011087.1|NM_011093.1|NM_011154.2|NM_021545.1|NM_031156.3|NM_133362.2|NM_177010.3|NM_181729.2" \

Lots of clipping on either side; the multiple alignments were often in different
chromosomes, also.

Searching the SAM files of a full transcriptome alignment for these NMs show
very little reads mapped to them:

$ for file in *.sam; do echo $file; grep -E "NM_001004145.2|NM_001013804.1|NM_001013828.2|NM_001039241.2|NM_001104634.1|NM_001163415.1|NM_001199242.1|NM_001199243.1|NM_001199332.1|NM_007849.1|NM_008848.1|NM_009251.1|NM_009744.3|NM_010381.2|NM_011087.1|NM_011093.1|NM_011154.2|NM_021545.1|NM_031156.3|NM_133362.2|NM_177010.3|NM_181729.2" \
    $file | wc -l; done

Looking at the alignments, there is no way we can choose out of the two. Some-
times we don't even understand why they are split, since they seem to consist of
two subsequent mappings, but since very little reads map to these transcripts,
we choose to ignore them instead of trying to fix (?) the aligner.



Also, the script parsing the CIGAR string encounters transcripts with deletions
and insertions compared to the genome.
It is not reliably possible to deal with these. So we'll remove them from the
FASTA sequences and re-align all the reads.

How many transcripts (XM and NM check):
$ grep -E "(N|X)M_" RefseqFASTA_mapped-to-genome_maxpath_2.sam | cut -f 1,6 | grep -E "D|I" | cut -d "|" -f 4 > problematic_transcripts.txt

919 transcripts

So how many reads align currently to these transcripts?
$ grep -f ../../GMAP_TranscriptsAlignTOGenome/problematic_transcripts.txt merged_A1.fastq.trunc.transcriptome.sam_mappedforward.sam_mappedforward_M25.sam_6col | wc -l

33664

(these reads are not necessarily lost; we could regain them by genome alignment)

So how many of these will we have issues with with the genome alignment, since
the ATG is too close to an exon/intron border?

$ grep -f ../../GMAP_TranscriptsAlignTOGenome/problematic_transcripts.txt ./seq_gene_mouse.md.distance_intron_to_ATG.txt | wc -l
65

How many reads?

$ grep -f ../../GMAP_TranscriptsAlignTOGenome/problematic_transcripts_no_chance_for_genomic_alignment.txt merged_A1.fastq.trunc.transcriptome.sam_mappedforward.sam_mappedforward_M25.sam_6col | wc -l
1362



All transcripts with mapping issues to the genome are put in a separate file
created when running the script. This file is named
transcriptome_alignment_unsupported_transcripts.txt.
For each transcript, the reason why it was rejected is put in the second column.

The output file mm10_transcript_positions.txt contains the transcript ID, the
chromosome, the strand, and the exon positions encoded in JSON.
